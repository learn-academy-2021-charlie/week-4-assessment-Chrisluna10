# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: The instance variable in Ruby means a variable belongs to the instance of a class. This is different from other variables because it is only used in Ruby classes.w

  Researched answer: You can't just access an instance variable from outside of an object, as you can with variables in JavaScript. Think local scope.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in Ruby is a piece of code that accepts an argument and returns a value. 

  Researched answer:A block is the same thing as a method, but it does not belong to an object. A block is always invoked with a function or can say passed to a method call.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Return does not have to be called for you to recieve an output.

  Researched answer: Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method. In the implicit_return method, as if true is always evaluated as true (mister obvious) then the last executed instruction is 42.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming relies on classes and objects.

  Researched answer:In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for objects while the object is the actual property within the class.

  Researched answer: 
A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects. An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class. 



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: The attr_accessor is used to have getters and setters together.

  Researched answer: Using attr_accessor allows us to set and get values from outside of the class.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, also called just Postgres, is one type of SQL. Postgres is an open source object-relational database management system, which means Postgres looks at databases through an object-oriented programming (OOP) lens.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications. 

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most. 

4. ORM: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. 

5. Active Record: An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.
